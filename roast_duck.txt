Remove any excess fat from inside the cavity of the duck,
then using a sharp knife carefully score the breast and legs all over
in crisscross fashion, roughly 1cm apart. Season the duck with salt,
pepper and the five-spice, rubbing all over so the flavour catches in
all the nooks and crannies. Halve the clementine and place it into the
cavity along with the bay leaves. Place the duck in a medium-sized
roasting tray, cook at 180°C/350°F/gas 4 for around 1 hour 20 minutes. 

When the time’s up, remove the duck from the oven and drizzle your 
par-boiled veg (see Gorgeous roast vegetables) with some of the fat 
from the tray then toss to coat (save the remaining fat for another day).
Lift up the duck, scatter the garlic, carrots and onions into the tray 
and sit the duck back on top. Cook for a further 40 minutes, or until 
the duck is beautifully crisp and the meat falls easily away from the bone.

Remove the duck to the tray of roast veg while you finish your gravy. 
Add the flour to the broken-down veg, then mash everything together 
with a potato masher, scraping up all the sticky goodness from the bottom. 
Place over a medium-high heat. Pour in the Marsala, stir well and let 
the alcohol cook off for a minute or two. Add the stock, then bring to
the boil and reduce to a simmer for around 15 minutes, or until
thickened and reduced. Strain through a coarse sieve, skim away
any fat from the surface, then season to taste. Shred or carve 
up the duck, then serve with a jug of gravy, apple and cranberry 
sauce, crispy roast veg and all the trimmings.
